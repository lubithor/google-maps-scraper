# google-maps-scraper
Scrapes Google Maps Effectively


For the no email (this will not go into the website attached to the google listing and gather the email):
Run this:
Node google-maps-scraper-no-email.cjs

Input in the code
{ query: "roofing companies", location: "Washington" }.
{ query: "roofing companies", location: "Washington" }

Etc, etc.

-- if you want to run with email, it is much slower, just run the other java file. 

Run:
Node server.js
